# Learning-Latex
As of now I am now dedicated to learning Latex. I will be reading through "Math Into Latex" by George Gratzer (https://www.amazon.com/Math-Into-LaTeX-George-Gr%C3%A4tzer/dp/0817641319/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1542784323&sr=1-5) and "Getting Started with Latex" by David R. Wilkens (https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/). I will then post my notes here.
