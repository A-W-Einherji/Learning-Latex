The goal of this LaTex Project is to become very comfortable with LaTex. The sources I will be using to learn LaTex are: "Math Into LaTex" by George Gr√§tzer, and  "Getting Started with Latex" by David R. Wilkens. Note other sources may potentially be used, and I will link them as they are used. I will post my personal notes here, essentially in the style of lectures of notes. The goal of these notes will be to provide a valuable aid to the above sources as well be means for others to learn the valuable skill of LaTex.
